The primary purpose of this Indexer is to provide a REST API interface of API calls to support searching the Algorand Blockchain. The Indexer REST APIs retrieve the blockchain data from a PostgreSQL compatible database that must be populated. This database is populated using the same indexer instance or a separate instance of the indexer which must connect to the algod process of a running Algorand node to read block data. This node must also be an Archival node to make searching the entire blockchain possible.
